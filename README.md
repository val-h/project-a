A dying planet inhabited by a toaster population. Desperately, they are seeking a way to survive. Three chosen ones, three best friends, embark on a journey to find a new home, two of which fail. One of them falls in battle, the other joins our hero and together, after many battles, they stumble across Earth and chose it as a new home.

Intro:
As the resources in the planet are exhausted, every remaining toaster gets on spaceships, headed towards an emergency space station, fueled with limited resources. As they arrive, they hold a meeting to decide what to do. Three toasters are chosen, each with different abilities - a reborn ancient warrior, a priestess and a mage. Each of them embarks on a journey in a different direction, to find a new possible home for their fellow toasters.
